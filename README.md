# Node-HTML

I had a lot of trouble with this material from the beginning.
I watched a lot of videos on how to make fully functioning HTMLs with node and making the prompts work correctly.
I know I didn't do exactly what the readme asked, but I found that I could do it all through one JS file and it still seems to work correctly.
